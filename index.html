            <div class="blog-text">
                <p>After finishing my 10th grade, I discovered my love for video games went beyond just playing. I had always been fascinated by the intricate worlds within games—the stories, the challenges, and the immersive experiences they offered. What started as a hobby soon turned into a deep passion. The thrill of solving puzzles, navigating complex levels, and unlocking achievements gave me immense joy. But at some point, simply playing these games wasn't enough for me. I wanted to know how they were made.</p>
                
                <p>That curiosity led me to explore the world of game development. I started small, learning the basics of programming through languages like Python and Java. My very first attempt was creating a simple Snake Game in Python. Though the game was basic, it felt like a huge accomplishment. I realized that the same logic behind the games I enjoyed could be used to build my own. I was hooked!</p>
                
                <p>As my skills grew, so did the complexity of the games I wanted to create. My next major project was the Brick Breaker Game in Java. This game involved more sophisticated mechanics—such as collision detection, scoring systems, and more interactive elements. I spent countless hours refining it, learning valuable lessons about game physics and user experience along the way.</p>
                
                <p>Soon, I discovered tools like Blender and Unreal Engine, which opened up entirely new possibilities for me. My transition from 2D to 3D game development was a thrilling and challenging journey. Working in 3D meant more than just code; it was about bringing visual elements to life, sculpting characters, and creating worlds where players could immerse themselves.</p>
                <p>My most significant project so far has been Cyber Run, a 3D adventure platformer game. This project allowed me to fully explore what I had learned over the years—from designing game mechanics to building immersive levels. The process of crafting this game was a massive learning experience. Each step, from the initial concept to the final polish, made me appreciate the complexity and artistry that goes into game development. Publishing Cyber Run on itch.io was a proud moment for me. It wasn't just about completing a game; it was the realization of a dream that had started years ago, with me sitting at a computer trying to understand how games worked.</p>
                <p>But my journey didn’t stop there. Alongside game development, I ventured into the world of NFTs. I created and published a collection of unique NFTs on OpenSea, each one representing a part of my creative evolution. This project helped me understand how digital art and blockchain could merge, creating entirely new avenues for artists and developers.</p>
                <p>Through every game I’ve built and every challenge I’ve faced, one thing has remained constant: my passion for creating experiences that others can enjoy. From the time I was just a gamer in love with video games, to becoming a developer who builds them, this journey has been more rewarding than I could have ever imagined.</p>
                <p>And this is just the beginning. There are more games to build, more worlds to create, and more experiences to share.</p>
